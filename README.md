# Image Puzzle Game

This is an Image Puzzle Game where you can choose any image you like. After selecting an image, you can choose a level Easy, Medium, or Hard. The Easy level is a 3x3 puzzle with a 1-minute timer, the Medium level is 4x4 with a 1 minute 30 seconds timer, and the Hard level is 5x5 with a 2 minute 30 seconds timer. You have to complete the puzzle within the given time, or the time will run out. To help you while solving, a preview image is also provided for reference.

My opinion about choosing an image:
I suggest selecting an image that doesn’t have too many areas of the same color. When an image has large sections of a single color, the puzzle pieces look too similar, making it harder to place them in the correct position.
